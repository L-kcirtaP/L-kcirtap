I'm a developer, interested in many aspects of computer science and programming.
I graduated from the Chinese Unversity of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. It's a beautiful campus, and I really miss that place and my friends in there. Currently, I'm working in ByteDance@Beijing as a server-side R&D engineer.
I will always stand by open source and free software, for it inspiring tech innovation, building better quality software, and most importantly, software should be used for every ordinary people and improve their lives, instead of making profits for the own sake of big companies and governments.
Reach me by sending email to yangliu@link.cuhk.edu.cn, or liuyang.42@bytedance.com if you're looking for a job at ByteDance.
Look forward to making friend with u.
